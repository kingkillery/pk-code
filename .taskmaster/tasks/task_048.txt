# Task ID: 48
# Title: Integrate Browser Configuration with `.mcp.json`
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 47
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the `pk config browser` command to the `.mcp.json` configuration file, enabling it to read and write the browser user data directory path.
# Details:
The logic for `pk config browser` should read the `.mcp.json` file. Upon successful path input from the user, it must validate that the directory path exists on the filesystem. If valid, it will update the `BROWSER_USE_USER_DATA_DIR` key within the `browser-use` server configuration object and save the file. Handle cases where the file or keys do not yet exist.

# Test Strategy:
Check the state of `.mcp.json` before running the command. Run `pk config browser`, provide a valid path, and confirm that `.mcp.json` is correctly updated. Test again by providing an invalid/non-existent path and verify that the command shows an error and does not update the configuration file.
