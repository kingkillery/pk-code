# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 50, 51, 52
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the user experience by adding robust error handling and clear, actionable feedback across all new commands and features.
# Details:
Review all new code paths and implement checks for potential failures. This includes: `browser-use` package not being installed, configured Chrome path not existing, agent already running when `start` is called, agent not running when `stop` is called, stale PID file, and MCP port conflicts. For each case, provide a clear, user-friendly error message and exit gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Systematically trigger each error condition. For example: uninstall `browser-use`, run `pk agent start browser`. Configure a bad path, run `start`. Run `start` twice. Manually kill the agent process, then run `stop`. Verify that in each case, the CLI outputs a helpful error message and does not crash.
