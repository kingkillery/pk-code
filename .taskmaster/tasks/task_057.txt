# Task ID: 57
# Title: Intelligent Retry & Fail-Over with Self-Reflection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 61
# Priority: high
# Description: Wrap tool calls with an intelligent retry and fail-over mechanism. This system will integrate with self-reflection loops (from #61) to analyze failures, adjust strategy, and then retry or fail-over to a fallback LLM (GPT-4o).
# Details:
This creates a more intelligent failure recovery system that learns from errors rather than just mechanically retrying. The goal is to improve robustness and task success rate by dynamically adapting to tool call failures.

# Test Strategy:
Develop a test plan to validate the entire intelligent recovery system. Simulate various failure conditions (network issues, API limits, malformed responses, invalid tool parameters) to ensure the self-reflection loop is triggered correctly and that its strategic adjustments lead to successful retries or graceful failovers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Failure Detection and Self-Reflection Trigger [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a wrapper that detects tool call failures (e.g., JSON errors, timeouts). Instead of a simple retry, this wrapper should trigger the self-reflection loop (#61), passing it the context of the failure.
### Details:


## 2. Integrate Self-Reflection Output into Retry/Fail-Over Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1
### Description: After the self-reflection loop analyzes the failure, use its output to decide the next step. This could be retrying the tool call with an adjusted strategy, retrying with the same model, or failing over to the fallback LLM (GPT-4o).
### Details:


## 3. Enhance Logging for Self-Reflection and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1, 57.2
### Description: Expand logging to capture the entire intelligent recovery process. This includes the initial failure, the trigger of the self-reflection loop, the analysis/strategy generated by the reflection, and the final recovery action (retry or failover).
### Details:


## 4. Implement Informative Final Failure Messaging [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1, 57.2
### Description: If the entire recovery process (including self-reflection and fallback attempts) fails, create a clear, informative error message for the user. The message should briefly explain that an intelligent recovery was attempted and failed, providing guidance on how to report the issue.
### Details:


## 5. Test Intelligent Recovery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1, 57.2, 57.3, 57.4
### Description: Test the complete intelligent recovery system under various failure conditions to ensure the self-reflection loop is triggered correctly and that its strategic adjustments lead to successful retries or graceful failovers.
