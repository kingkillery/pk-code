# Product Requirements Document: Sub-Agent System for PK-Code

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of a multi-agent system for PK-Code that enables parallel execution of specialized AI agents through headless mode invocation. The system will allow users to define custom agents via Markdown files with YAML front-matter, automatically route queries to appropriate agents, and execute multiple agents concurrently to improve performance and specialization.

## Problem Statement

Currently, PK-Code operates as a single-agent system, creating bottlenecks when handling complex tasks that could benefit from specialized expertise or parallel processing. Users need the ability to:

- Delegate specific tasks to specialized agents (e.g., testing, documentation, security review)
- Run multiple agents in parallel to reduce wall-clock time
- Maintain isolation between agent contexts to prevent state bleeding
- Customize agent behavior through configuration files

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. **Performance**: Achieve ~3x faster execution for parallelizable tasks
2. **Accuracy**: ≥80% correct agent delegation on first attempt
3. **Reliability**: ≥99.9% success rate with provider fallback mechanisms
4. **Usability**: Users can create and deploy custom agents in <5 minutes
5. **Safety**: Maintain tool sandboxing and audit trails for all agent actions

### Success Metrics

- Parallel execution overhead ≤400ms compared to single-agent mode
- Agent delegation accuracy ≥80% on test suite of 50 sample prompts
- System uptime ≥99.9% with fallback providers
- User onboarding time <5 minutes for first custom agent

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Advanced Developers and Teams

**As a developer, I want to:**

- Define specialized agents for different domains (testing, documentation, security)
- Automatically route queries to the most appropriate agent
- Run multiple agents in parallel for complex multi-faceted tasks
- Explicitly invoke specific agents when needed
- Maintain audit logs of agent actions for compliance

**As a team lead, I want to:**

- Share standardized agent configurations across team members
- Ensure consistent code review and testing practices through specialized agents
- Monitor agent performance and delegation accuracy
- Control tool permissions for different agent types

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture

#### 1. Agent Definition System

- **File Format**: Markdown files with YAML front-matter
- **Storage Locations**:
  - Project-specific: `.pk/agents/`
  - User-global: `~/.pk/agents/`
- **Schema**: JSON Schema validation for YAML front-matter
- **Hot-reloading**: Dynamic agent discovery without CLI restart

#### 2. Headless Mode Integration

- **CLI Support**: Leverage existing `-p/--prompt` flag for non-interactive execution
- **Process Isolation**: Each agent runs in separate context/process
- **Tool Restrictions**: Whitelist-based tool permissions per agent
- **Authentication**: Environment variable-based API key management

#### 3. Routing and Delegation

- **Initial Implementation**: Keyword/heuristic-based routing
- **Future Enhancement**: Embedding-based similarity matching
- **Explicit Invocation**: `pk use <agent>: "<query>"` syntax
- **Fallback**: Default to general-purpose agent if no match

#### 4. Parallel Execution Engine

- **Concurrency Model**: Promise.allSettled() for I/O-bound operations
- **Worker Threads**: For CPU-intensive tasks (conditional)
- **Timeout Handling**: AbortController for hung processes
- **Result Aggregation**: Structured output merging

#### 5. Safety and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of agent actions and tool usage
- **Tool Sandboxing**: Per-agent tool permission enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on agent failures
- **Provider Fallback**: Automatic retry with alternate LLM providers

### Agent Configuration Schema

```yaml
---
name: "TestGuru"
description: "Specialized agent for test coverage analysis and improvement"
model: "gpt-4"  # Optional model override
tools: ["readFile", "searchWeb", "runCommand"]  # Whitelist of allowed tools
priority: "high"  # Routing priority
keywords: ["test", "coverage", "unit test", "integration test"]
---

# Agent Instructions
You are a testing specialist focused on analyzing and improving test coverage...

## Examples
<example>
User: "Can you review our test coverage?"
Agent: "I'll analyze your test files and generate a coverage report..."
</example>
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Agent Loader & Schema (Target: Aug 23, 2025)

- File discovery mechanism for agent definitions
- YAML parser with JSON Schema validation
- Hot-reloading capability
- Name collision handling (project > global preference)
- Error handling for invalid agent files

### Phase 2: Routing & Delegation Logic (Target: Sep 6, 2025)

- Keyword-based routing implementation
- Explicit agent invocation syntax
- Test suite of 50 sample prompts
- Delegation accuracy measurement and tuning
- Default fallback behavior

### Phase 3: Parallel Executor (Target: Sep 20, 2025)

- Asynchronous agent spawning with Promise.allSettled()
- Timeout and error handling
- Result aggregation framework
- Performance benchmarking (≤400ms overhead target)
- Worker thread integration for CPU-bound tasks

### Phase 4: Provider Fallback & Resilience (Target: Oct 4, 2025)

- Multi-provider fallback chains
- Rate limit and network error handling
- Configurable retry policies
- Health monitoring and alerting
- 99.9% uptime target validation

### Phase 5: Developer Experience & Documentation (Target: Oct 18, 2025)

- Hello World Agent example
- Comprehensive documentation
- CLI commands for agent management (`pk list-agents`)
- User onboarding flow optimization
- Public beta preparation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Performance Degradation**: Parallel execution overhead exceeding 400ms
  - _Mitigation_: Extensive benchmarking and optimization
- **Context Window Limitations**: Large agent definitions consuming too much context
  - _Mitigation_: Agent prompt optimization and context management
- **Provider Rate Limits**: Concurrent API calls hitting rate limits
  - _Mitigation_: Request queuing and intelligent backoff

### Security Risks

- **Tool Permission Bypass**: Agents accessing unauthorized tools
  - _Mitigation_: Strict whitelist enforcement and audit logging
- **Malicious Agent Definitions**: User-created agents with harmful instructions
  - _Mitigation_: Safe YAML parsing and tool sandboxing

### User Experience Risks

- **Poor Delegation Accuracy**: Users frustrated by incorrect agent routing
  - _Mitigation_: Comprehensive test suite and continuous improvement
- **Complex Configuration**: Difficulty creating custom agents
  - _Mitigation_: Clear documentation and examples
