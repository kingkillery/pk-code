# Product Requirements Document: Sub-Agent System for PK-Code

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of a multi-agent system for PK-Code that enables parallel execution of specialized AI agents through headless mode invocation. The system will allow users to define custom agents via Markdown files with YAML front-matter, automatically route queries to appropriate agents, and execute multiple agents concurrently to improve performance and specialization.

## Problem Statement

Currently, PK-Code operates as a single-agent system, creating bottlenecks when handling complex tasks that could benefit from specialized expertise or parallel processing. Users need the ability to:

- Delegate specific tasks to specialized agents (e.g., testing, documentation, security review)
- Run multiple agents in parallel to reduce wall-clock time
- Maintain isolation between agent contexts to prevent state bleeding
- Customize agent behavior through configuration files

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. **Performance**: Achieve ~3x faster execution for parallelizable tasks
2. **Accuracy**: â‰¥80% correct agent delegation on first attempt
3. **Reliability**: â‰¥99.9% success rate with provider fallback mechanisms
4. **Usability**: Users can create and deploy custom agents in <5 minutes
5. **Safety**: Maintain tool sandboxing and audit trails for all agent actions

### Success Metrics

- Parallel execution overhead â‰¤400ms compared to single-agent mode
- Agent delegation accuracy â‰¥80% on test suite of 50 sample prompts
- System uptime â‰¥99.9% with fallback providers
- User onboarding time <5 minutes for first custom agent

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Advanced Developers and Teams

**As a developer, I want to:**

- Define specialized agents for different domains (testing, documentation, security)
- Automatically route queries to the most appropriate agent
- Run multiple agents in parallel for complex multi-faceted tasks
- Explicitly invoke specific agents when needed
- Maintain audit logs of agent actions for compliance

**As a team lead, I want to:**

- Share standardized agent configurations across team members
- Ensure consistent code review and testing practices through specialized agents
- Monitor agent performance and delegation accuracy
- Control tool permissions for different agent types

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture

#### 1. Agent Definition System

- **File Format**: Markdown files with YAML front-matter
- **Storage Locations**:
  - Project-specific: `.pk/agents/`
  - User-global: `~/.pk/agents/`
- **Schema**: JSON Schema validation for YAML front-matter
- **Hot-reloading**: Dynamic agent discovery without CLI restart

#### 2. Headless Mode Integration

- **CLI Support**: Leverage existing `-p/--prompt` flag for non-interactive execution
- **Process Isolation**: Each agent runs in separate context/process
- **Tool Restrictions**: Whitelist-based tool permissions per agent
- **Authentication**: Environment variable-based API key management

#### 3. Routing and Delegation

- **Initial Implementation**: Keyword/heuristic-based routing
- **Future Enhancement**: Embedding-based similarity matching
- **Explicit Invocation**: `pk use <agent>: "<query>"` syntax
- **Fallback**: Default to general-purpose agent if no match

#### 4. Parallel Execution Engine

- **Concurrency Model**: Promise.allSettled() for I/O-bound operations
- **Worker Threads**: For CPU-intensive tasks (conditional)
- **Timeout Handling**: AbortController for hung processes
- **Result Aggregation**: Structured output merging

#### 5. Safety and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of agent actions and tool usage
- **Tool Sandboxing**: Per-agent tool permission enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on agent failures
- **Provider Fallback**: Automatic retry with alternate LLM providers

### Agent Configuration Schema

```yaml
---
name: "TestGuru"
description: "Specialized agent for test coverage analysis and improvement"
model: "gpt-4"  # Optional model override
tools: ["readFile", "searchWeb", "runCommand"]  # Whitelist of allowed tools
priority: "high"  # Routing priority
keywords: ["test", "coverage", "unit test", "integration test"]
---

# Agent Instructions
You are a testing specialist focused on analyzing and improving test coverage...

  Hypothetical Architecture: 

  Hypothetical Architecture for Parallel Sub-agents in Claude Code
1. Overview
This architecture enables Claude Code to handle complex, multi-faceted user requests by decomposing them into sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel by specialized sub-agents. The core of this system is a central Orchestrator that manages the entire lifecycle of a task, a Shared State Blackboard for inter-agent communication, and a pool of stateful Agent Instances. This design allows for simultaneous work on different aspects of a project (e.g., backend, frontend, database) while ensuring agents can share progress and dependencies without polluting their individual context windows.
2. Core Principles
Delegation and Decomposition: A high-level user goal is broken down into a dependency graph of smaller, actionable tasks.
Parallel Execution: Independent tasks are assigned to different sub-agents and run concurrently to minimize total execution time.
Stateful, Isolated Contexts: Each agent operates with its own context window and system prompt, ensuring specialization and focus.
Asynchronous Communication: Agents do not communicate directly. Instead, they post and retrieve information from a shared, structured state, preventing deadlocks and allowing them to work at their own pace.
3. System Components
Here are the key components of the architecture:
A. The Orchestrator Core
The Orchestrator is the brain of the system. It is a stateless, high-level meta-agent that does not perform the work itself but manages the agents that do.
1. Task Planner & Decomposer:
Receives the initial user prompt (e.g., "Build an MVP for my food delivery app").
Analyzes the request and breaks it down into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. For the example, this would be:
Design Database Schema (No dependencies)
Build Backend APIs (Depends on 1)
Create Frontend Components (Depends on 2)
Integrate Payments (Depends on 2 & 3)
Set up CI/CD (Depends on 2 & 3)
2. Agent Scheduler & Dispatcher:
Matches each task in the DAG to the most appropriate sub-agent based on the agent's description.
Identifies tasks with no pending dependencies and dispatches them to be run in parallel.
Instantiates and "spawns" an Agent Instance for each task.
3. State Monitor & Event Bus:
Continuously monitors the Shared State Blackboard for updates (e.g., task_completed, artifact_created).
When a task is marked as complete, it checks the DAG to see which new tasks have had their dependencies met and dispatches them.
4. Result Synthesizer:
Once all tasks in the DAG are complete, it gathers the final artifacts and summaries from the Blackboard.
It synthesizes these results into a coherent, final response for the user.
B. Agent Instances
Each sub-agent is spawned as a stateful "Agent Instance" when a task is dispatched.
Context Window: A private, isolated conversational history for the agent to perform its work.
System Prompt & Tools: Loaded from its .md configuration file.
Blackboard Interface: A set of functions (read_state, write_state) that allow the agent to interact with the Shared State Blackboard. This interface is passed into the agent's context as a tool.
C. Shared State Blackboard
This is the central nervous system for inter-agent communication. It's a structured, key-value data store that all agents can read from and write to.
Structure: A JSON-like object that contains:
task_status: A dictionary mapping task names to their status (pending, running, completed, failed).
artifacts: A dictionary where agents post their outputs (e.g., db_schema.sql, api_endpoints.json, component_list.js).
shared_notes: A space for agents to leave messages or findings for other agents (e.g., "API endpoint for user authentication is /api/auth/login").
Operations:
write_state(key, value): Atomically updates a value on the blackboard.
read_state(key): Retrieves a value.
subscribe(key): (For the Orchestrator) Listens for changes to a specific key.
D. Tool Execution Environment
A sandboxed environment where agents can safely execute tools like bash, write_file, etc. The results of tool execution are returned only to the calling Agent Instance.

5. Detailed Workflow Example: "Build an MVP for my food delivery app"
User Prompt: The user enters the request.
Task Decomposition: The Orchestrator's Planner breaks this into tasks: design_schema, build_api, create_frontend, etc., and creates a dependency graph.
Agent Spawning (Parallel): The Scheduler sees that design_schema and create_frontend_wireframes have no dependencies. It spawns two Agent Instances simultaneously:
backend-architect (task: design_schema)
ui-ux-designer (task: create_frontend_wireframes)
Parallel Execution & Communication:
The backend-architect agent runs, decides on a database schema, and uses its write_state tool to post the SQL code to the Blackboard at artifacts.db_schema. It then posts task_status.design_schema = 'completed'.
Concurrently, the ui-ux-designer creates a list of required UI components and posts it to artifacts.component_list. It then marks its task as complete.
Monitoring and New Task Dispatch:
The State Monitor sees that design_schema is complete. It checks the DAG and sees that the build_api task's dependencies are now met.
It dispatches a new backend-developer agent with the task build_api. This new agent uses read_state to get artifacts.db_schema from the Blackboard to know how to build the APIs.
Continuous Cycle: This process continues as agents complete tasks and unlock new ones in the dependency graph. The frontend-developer agent might start its work as soon as the build_api agent posts the API endpoints to the Blackboard, running in parallel with the payment-integrator agent.
Result Synthesis: Once the State Monitor sees that all tasks in the graph are completed, the Result Synthesizer collects all the key information from the Blackboard (links to created files, summaries of work done) and presents a final, comprehensive update to the user.
This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and efficient way to leverage multiple specialized AI agents for complex software development tasks, directly addressing the need for parallel execution and structured communication.
