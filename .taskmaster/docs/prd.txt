## 4. Key Features / Requirements

This section breaks down the major features required to meet the project's goals. For each feature, a description and a set of acceptance criteria are provided.

| # | Feature | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Multi-Provider Support** | This feature is the foundational architectural component that allows `qwen-code` to support multiple AI providers. It will consist of a modular system where each provider is implemented as a self-contained package. The system will define a standardized interface that each provider package must adhere to, ensuring consistent behavior across the platform. For the MVP, this system will be built to support at least two initial providers (e.g., OpenAI and Gemini), but designed for easy expansion to include others in the future. This directly addresses the core user problem of being locked into a single provider's ecosystem. | - The system can be configured to use at least two different AI providers (e.g., OpenAI and Gemini).<br>- The application successfully makes API calls to the configured providers using the correct credentials and parameters.<br>- The provider implementation is modular, and adding a new provider requires minimal changes to the core application logic. |
| 2 | **Unified CLI** | This feature provides the primary user interface for interacting with the `qwen-code` assistant from the command line. It will be a single, intuitive CLI application that allows users to access the functionality of any integrated AI provider through a consistent set of commands. For the MVP, the CLI will support basic commands for configuration, authentication, and code generation. It will be built with modern technologies to be functional and reliable, laying the groundwork for a richer, more interactive UI in later versions. | - The CLI has a `qwen-code` command that provides access to all its features.<br>- The CLI includes commands for configuring providers, managing authentication, and generating code.<br>- The CLI provides clear and helpful error messages for invalid commands or failed operations. |
| 3 | **Centralized Authentication** | This feature will provide a secure and centralized mechanism for users to manage their API keys for the various AI providers. Users will be able to add, remove, and switch between different credentials through a simple set of CLI commands. The credentials will be stored securely on the user's local machine. This feature is critical for simplifying the user experience, as it eliminates the need to manage separate authentication configurations for each provider. | - A user can add a new API key for a supported provider using a CLI command.<br>- A user can list all configured credentials.<br>- A user can remove a credential using a CLI command.<br>- The application uses the correct credentials when making API calls to a provider. |
| 4 | **Code Generation** | This is the core functional feature of the MVP. It will enable users to generate code snippets, functions, or classes by providing a natural language prompt via the CLI. The user will be able to specify which configured AI provider they want to use for the generation task. The generated code will be output directly to the console, from where the user can copy it. This feature delivers the primary value proposition of an AI coding assistant. | - A user can generate a code snippet by providing a natural language prompt to the CLI.<br>- A user can specify which configured provider to use for the code generation.<br>- The generated code is displayed in the console. |
| 5 | **Comprehensive Documentation** | This feature involves creating clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation for all features included in the MVP. The documentation will cover installation, configuration, authentication, and usage of the CLI commands. It will include practical examples to help new users get started quickly. High-quality documentation is essential for user adoption and for establishing `qwen-code` as a professional-grade developer tool. | - The documentation includes clear instructions for installing the CLI.<br>- The documentation provides a step-by-step guide for configuring providers and adding credentials.<br>- The documentation includes examples of how to use the code generation feature.<br>- The documentation is accessible online. |

## 5. Non-functional Requirements

This section outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the qwen-code project. These NFRs define the quality attributes of the system and are essential for ensuring a positive user experience.

### 1. Performance

*   **Response Time:** The average response time for any CLI command (excluding time spent waiting for the AI provider's API) must be less than 200 milliseconds.
*   **API Latency:** The P95 latency for all API calls made to AI providers (measured as the time from when the request is sent to when the response is received) should be under 500ms, not including the provider's processing time.
*   **Resource Utilization:** The CLI application should consume no more than 100MB of RAM during normal operation.
*   **Startup Time:** The CLI application should start and be ready to accept commands in under 1 second.

### 2. Scalability

*   **User Growth:** The system must be able to support a 10x increase in the number of active users over a 12-month period without a significant degradation in performance.
*   **Provider Integration:** The platform must be able to support the integration of up to 20 AI providers without requiring a major architectural redesign.
*   **Concurrent Usage:** The system must be able to handle at least 100 concurrent users making requests to the AI providers without a significant increase in API latency or error rates.

### 3. Security

*   **Credential Storage:** All user credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) must be stored securely on the user's local machine using industry-standard encryption methods.
*   **Data Transmission:** All data transmitted between the user's machine and the AI providers' APIs must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   **Input Validation:** All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as command injection.
*   **Dependency Management:** All third-party dependencies must be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities, and any high-risk vulnerabilities must be addressed in a timely manner.

### 4. Compatibility

*   **Operating Systems:** The CLI must be compatible with the latest stable versions of the following operating systems:
    *   Windows 10 and higher
    *   macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher
    *   Ubuntu 20.04 and higher
*   **Node.js:** The application must be compatible with the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js.
*   **VS Code:** The VS Code extension must be compatible with the latest stable version of Visual Studio Code.
