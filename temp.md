# Codebase Review #1

- ### Implementation Summary

  PK Code’s sub‑agent system is described in `packages/core/src/agents/ARCHITECTURE.md`. It routes queries to specialized agents, can execute several agents in parallel, and aggregates the results:

  ```
  The PK-Code sub-agent system is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture designed to intelligently route queries to specialized AI agents, execute them in parallel or sequentially, and aggregate results for optimal user experience. The system achieves ≥80% routing accuracy with ≤400ms overhead compared to single-agent execution.
  ```

  

  The architecture includes an `Agent Router` for selecting agents, an `Agent Executor` for running them concurrently, a `Result Aggregator`, and an `Agent Orchestrator` coordinating the flow.

  The CLI exposes commands like `/agent create`, `/agent list`, and `/agent delete` to manage sub‑agents. Example snippet:

  ```
  name: 'list-agents',
  altName: 'agents',
  description: 'List all available sub-agents',
  ```

  

  Parallel execution is handled by `executeParallel()` in the executor:

  ```
  /** Execute agents in parallel with concurrency control */
  private async executeParallel(
    routingResults: RoutingResult[],
    query: string,
    options: ExecutionOptions,
    maxConcurrency: number,
  ): Promise<AgentExecutionResult[]> {
    ...
    const remainingResults = await Promise.allSettled(Array.from(executing));
    ...
  }
  ```

  

  ### Current Functionality and Limitations

  While routing, concurrent execution, and aggregation are coded, the implementation is not fully integrated. For example, `createContentGenerator()` simply throws an error unless a factory is passed in:

  ```
  throw new Error(
    'Content generator factory not provided. This should be integrated with the existing PK-Code content generation system.'
  );
  ```

  

  The project’s task list shows many required pieces still marked “pending,” such as documentation, tool sandboxing, audit logging, provider fallback, and a comprehensive test suite.

  The PRD highlights that future work includes agent collaboration (inter-agent communication protocols):

  ### Question Responses

  1. **Simultaneous execution**: Yes. `AgentExecutor` supports parallel spawning through `Promise.allSettled` with configurable concurrency, enabling multiple agents to run at once.
  2. **Inter-agent communication**: No built-in mechanism currently exists. Communication is listed as a future enhancement (“Agent Collaboration: Inter-agent communication protocols”). Potential approaches could leverage PK Code’s existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) infrastructure or use an internal message bus to share state or requests between running agents.

  Overall, the core sub‑agent framework (routing, concurrent execution, and aggregation) is coded but not fully wired into the rest of the CLI, and additional features such as provider fallback, auditing, and inter-agent communication remain incomplete.

  # Codebase Review #2

The repository has a dedicated “sub‑agent system” in `packages/core/src/agents`. The architecture document describes how the system is supposed to work:

```
# PK-Code Sub-Agent System Architecture
…
The PK-Code sub-agent system is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture designed to intelligently route queries to specialized AI agents, execute them in parallel or sequentially, and aggregate results for optimal user experience. The system achieves ≥80% routing accuracy with ≤400ms overhead compared to single-agent execution.
```



Key features include a router, an executor that supports `Promise.allSettled` for concurrent execution, and a result aggregator:

```
### 2. Agent Executor (`agent-executor.ts`)
**Purpose**: High-performance parallel execution engine for agent invocations.

**Key Features**:
- Promise.allSettled() for concurrent execution
- Timeout handling and resource management
- Multiple execution strategies (parallel, sequential, prioritized)
```



The architecture diagram shows the multi-agent execution flow where agent selection leads to parallel execution and result aggregation:

### Implementation state

The repository contains implementations for the loader, registry, router, executor, aggregator, and orchestrator. Example test code demonstrates parallel execution:

```
it('should execute multiple agents in parallel', async () => {
  const options: ExecutionOptions = {
    contentGeneratorFactory: mockContentGeneratorFactory,
    aggregateResults: true,
  };

  const startTime = Date.now();
  const result = await executor.executeMultipleAgents(
    multiRoutingResult,
    'test query',
    options,
  );
  const totalTime = Date.now() - startTime;

  expect(result.status).toBe('success');
  expect(result.primaryResults).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(result.secondaryResults).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(result.strategy).toBe('parallel');
  expect(result.metadata.totalAgents).toBe(3);
  expect(result.metadata.successfulAgents).toBe(3);

  // Parallel execution should be faster than sequential
  expect(totalTime).toBeLessThan(3000); // Much less than sum of individual times
});
```



The executor’s parallel implementation uses concurrency control with `Promise.allSettled`:

```
private async executeParallel(
  routingResults: RoutingResult[],
  query: string,
  options: ExecutionOptions,
  maxConcurrency: number,
): Promise<AgentExecutionResult[]> {
  const results: AgentExecutionResult[] = [];
  const executing = new Set<Promise<AgentExecutionResult>>();

  for (let i = 0; i < routingResults.length; i++) {
    // Wait if we've reached max concurrency
    if (executing.size >= maxConcurrency) {
      const completed = await Promise.race(executing);
      executing.delete(Promise.resolve(completed));
      results.push(completed);
    }

    // Start execution
    const executionPromise = this.executeSingleAgent(
      routingResults[i],
      query,
      options,
    );
    executing.add(executionPromise);
  }

  // Wait for remaining executions
  const remainingResults = await Promise.allSettled(Array.from(executing));
  for (const result of remainingResults) {
    if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
      results.push(result.value);
    }
  }

  return results;
}
```



### Not yet fully integrated

The project’s task tracker indicates that while core pieces are implemented, some key tasks (such as tool sandboxing and audit logging) remain **pending**:

```
{
  "id": 35,
  "title": "Implement Per-Agent Tool Sandboxing",
  ...
  "status": "pending"
},
{
  "id": 36,
  "title": "Create Comprehensive Audit Logging System",
  ...
  "status": "pending"
}
```



The “Future Enhancements” section of the sub‑agent PRD lists “Agent Collaboration: Inter-agent communication protocols” as a post-MVP feature, showing that inter-agent communication has not yet been built:

```
### Post-MVP Features
- **Agent Marketplace**: Shared repository of community agents
- **Visual Agent Builder**: GUI for creating agent definitions
- **Advanced Routing**: Machine learning-based delegation
- **Agent Collaboration**: Inter-agent communication protocols
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed metrics and optimization suggestions
```



### Model Context Protocol

PK Code already integrates a “browser-use” agent using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

```
The `browser-use` library is integrated into the PK Code CLI, allowing agents to interact with live web applications. This integration is achieved through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with `browser-use` running as a separate MCP server.
```



### Summary

- **How it works:** Sub-agent definitions are stored as Markdown with YAML front matter. The `AgentLoader` and `AgentRegistry` discover these agents. The `AgentRouter` selects one or more agents for a query, the `AgentExecutor` can run them in parallel, and the `ResultAggregator` merges their outputs. The architecture aims for ≤400 ms overhead versus single-agent execution.
- **Is it fully functional?**
  No. Core modules exist and pass unit tests, but several roadmap items (tool sandboxing, audit logging, provider fallback, full CLI integration) remain “pending” in the task tracker. CLI commands currently execute one agent directly.
- **Parallel spawning:**
  Yes. The `executeParallel` method runs multiple agents concurrently with concurrency limits and is tested to confirm reduced wall‑clock time.
- **Inter-agent communication:**
  Not yet. Inter-agent communication is mentioned only as a future enhancement in the PRD. Currently agents do not share state or messages with each other.
- **Possible protocols:**
  A similar approach to the existing MCP integration could be adopted for agent-to-agent communication—e.g., using MCP as a message bus or employing lightweight messaging protocols (such as WebSocket or HTTP-based RPC) so agents can exchange structured data in a controlled way. This would allow collaboration while keeping each agent isolated.
